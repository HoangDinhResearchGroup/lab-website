                       <h4> 1) Next Generation Multiple Access (NGMA)</h4>
                       <p> Next generation wireless networks are expected to achieve significantly high capacity, extremely low latency, ultra high reliability, as well as massive and ubiquitous connectivity for supporting diverse disruptive applications. One of the most fundamental issues is the design of sophisticated multiple access (MA) techniques for the next generation wireless networks, namely next generation multiple access (NGMA). The key concept of NGMA is to enable a tremendous number of users/devices to be efficiently, flexibly, and intelligently connected with the network over the given wireless radio resources for not only satisfying stringent communication requirements but also realizing heterogenous functions. This project will explore the development of NGMA by exploiting NOMA and multiple antenna techniques with the aid of convex optimization and machine learning methods. In particular, a unified framework for NGMA is proposed based on multi-antenna transmission and NOMA, including both downlink and uplink multi-user communication scenarios. The aim of the proposed unified NGMA framework is to fully reap the benefits of multiple antenna and NOMA techniques and to enable highly flexible and customized communication services for future wireless networks. This opens up numerous research opportunities and directions.

                       <p> The novel concept of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is proposed in this project, where the incident wireless signal is divided into transmitted and reflected signals passing into both sides of the space surrounding the surface, thus facilitating a full-space manipulation of signal propagation. In this project, we will investigate (1) the fundamental electromagnetic and hardware models <a href="../../arxiv.org/abs/2103.09104">[Paper1]</a><a href="../../arxiv.org/abs/2104.10006">[Paper2]</a>; (2) the basic communication signal model and operating protocols <a href="../../arxiv.org/abs/2103.09104">[Paper1]</a><a href="../../arxiv.org/abs/2104.01421">[Paper4]</a>; (3) the corresponding fundamental performance analysis, beamforming design, and channel estimation methods <a href="../../arxiv.org/abs/2104.01421">[Paper4]</a><a href="../../arxiv.org/abs/2110.02374">[Paper5]</a><a href="../../arxiv.org/abs/2101.09663">[Paper6]</a><a href="../../arxiv.org/abs/2112.00299">[Paper7]</a>; (4) the interplay between STAR-RIS and other promising techniques and advanced tools <a href="../../arxiv.org/abs/2106.08592">[Paper7]</a>.

<!--                       <p> Uplink NGMA in 6G needs to serve massive intermittently active users whose number is much larger-->
<!--                       than the available orthogonal resource blocks (ORBs). To solve this problem, a promising approach is-->
<!--                       to group grant-based (GB) users with grant-free (GF) users in one NOMA cluster, which is defined as-->
<!--                       Semi-GF NOMA as shown in Fig. 1. The general process of Semi-GF NOMA is as follows: 1) The BS-->
<!--                       grants one ORB to each GB user; 2) The BS evaluates the power resource left for this ORB and then-->
<!--                       calculates a threshold for broadcasting; and 3) After receiving the broadcast threshold, the satisfied GF-->
<!--                       users transmit their messages to the BS via GF transmissions. Based on whether the maximum load in-->
<!--                       each ORB is available or not, the threshold design can be divided into single-ORB and multi-ORB cases.-->
<!--                       </br></br>-->
<!--                       For the single-ORB case, it can be assumed that the ORB for each GF user is pre-allocated and, hence,-->
<!--                       the number of potential GF users (PGFU) in each ORB is known in advance <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13286">[Paper]</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9244136">[Paper]</a>. If the GB user-->
<!--                       is delay-tolerant, several successive interference cancellation (SIC) iterations are acceptable. Therefore,-->
<!--                       the broadcast threshold contains two kinds of information: 1) Minimal transmit power (MTP); and 2)-->
<!--                       Maximal tolerance to interference (MTI). If GF users have transmit power higher than MTP, they upload-->
<!--                       messages and the successful GF users are decoded before the GB user. If GF users have transmit power-->
<!--                       lower than MTI, they are also able to upload messages that are decoded after the GB user. Note that the-->
<!--                       MTI needs to take all PGFUs into account to avoid the transmission outage of the GB user. If the GB-->
<!--                       user is delay-sensitive, it needs to be decoded firstly, so the threshold only contains the MTI.-->
<!--                       </br></br>-->
<!--                       For the multi-ORB case, the number of PGFUs for each ORB is unknown since GF users are capable-->
<!--                       of choosing ORBs at random, which results in a complicated threshold design. To reduce collisions, it is-->
<!--                       better to control the transmit power of Semi-GF NOMA. Based on channel gains, a power pool design-->
<!--                       with layered transmit power levels can be applied to decrease outage probabilities <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9452792">[Paper]</a>. By restricting the-->
<!--                       number of GF users in each ORB, an access class barring (ACB) aided user barring approach can-->
<!--                       be utilized to further enhance the connectivity <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03458">[Paper]</a>. However, the protocol design of semi-GF NOMA under-->
<!--                       multi-ORB cases still faces numerous challenges. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the connectivity of semi-GF-->
<!--                       NOMA with ideal power pool and user barring is the highest."-->

                       <h4> 3) Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) </h4>
                       <p>Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a promising technique for the next generation wireless network. Unlike the past five generations of wireless network where there is only one envisaged function, i.e., wireless communication, the next generation wireless network expects a paradigm shift to support multiple functions including the communication, sensing, control, and computation to meet the demand of the fusion techniques such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), autonomous driving, virtual and augmented reality, Internet of vehicles, and smart cities. In ISAC, the sensing and communication are not regarded as independent functions but are jointly designed toward the goals and mutual benefits of both, which introduce two gains to the wireless network, namely integration gain and coordination gain. Integration gain is from the dual usage of the signal, spectrum, and device in the ISAC for both functions, thereby reducing the cost. Coordination gain is from the deeper level integration in ISAC to achieve mutual assistance between the two functions, such as the communication-assisted sensing and the sensing-assisted communication. This project will explore the interplay between ISAC and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in the following aspect: 1) use NOMA to boost the load capability of ISAC <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04550">[Paper]</a>; 2) follow the concept of NOMA to manage or exploit the interference in ISAC; 3) investigate the potential of NOMA as the enabler of more sophisticated ISAC frameworks <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02372">[Paper]</a>.</p>

<!--                       <p> Smart homes and healthcare centres have a demand for multi subject health activity monitoring to cater for future requirements. Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) has great potential to realize unmanned, economical, contactless, and private E-health care for self-care recipients. ISAC E-health systems can sense daily activities and behaviours in residential settings with common communication hardware and radio frequency (RF) signals[1], and thereby providing insightful data relating to both pattern-of-life, and shorter-term monitoring such as inactivity and falls. These metrics are especially helpful for identifying health issues and chronic diseases, for which early treatment interventions are critical, as well as the prevention of tumble, pressure sores, and lower limb thrombosis. Moreover, ISAC E-health systems also employ a variety of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to play the role of the brain to analyse patients&#8217; activities and disease developments and provide basis and advice for the health management and doctor&#8217;s diagnosis. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9264288">[Paper]</a></p>-->

                           <h4>1)Non-Orthogonal Multiple access (NOMA) for Beyond 5G and IoT networks</h4>

                           <p>
                               Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), which has been recently proposed for the 3rd generation partnership projects long-term evolution advanced (3GPP-LTE-A), constitutes a promising technology of addressing the above-mentioned challenges in 5G networks by accommodating several users within the same orthogonal resource block. By doing so, significant bandwidth efficiency enhancement can be attained over conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques. This motivated numerous researchers to dedicate substantial research contributions to this field. We advocate on power-domain multiplexing aided NOMA, with a focus on the theoretical NOMA principles, multiple antenna aided NOMA design, on the interplay between NOMA and cooperative transmission, on the resource control of NOMA, semi-grant-free NOMA <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13286"> [Paper]</a>, on the co-existence of NOMA with other emerging potential 5G techniques and on the comparison with other NOMA variants. We highlight the main advantages of power-domain multiplexing NOMA compared to other existing NOMA techniques. We investigate the application of machine learning into NOMA networks <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08350"> [Paper]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08812"> [Paper]</a>.

                           <p>
                               This project proposes a novel framework for unmaned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks with massive access capability supported by non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In order to better understand NOMA enabled UAV networks, three case studies are carried out. We first provide performance evaluation of NOMA enabled UAV networks by adopting stochastic geometry to model the positions of UAVs and ground users <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04985"> [Paper]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13657"> [Paper] </a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03757"> [Paper]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05571"> [Paper]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01793"> [Paper]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09916"> [Paper]</a>. Then we investigate the joint trajectory design and power allocation for static NOMA users based on a simplified two-dimensional (2D) model that UAV is flying around at fixed height <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06523"> [Paper]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11501"> [Paper]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13630"> [Paper]</a>.  As a further advance, we demonstrate the UAV placement issue with the aid of machine learning techniques when the ground users are roaming and the UAVs are capable of adjusting their positions in three-dimensions (3D) accordingly <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11958"> [Paper]</a>  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05242"> [Paper]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07665"> [Paper]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05242"> [Paper]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10408"> [Paper]</a>.

                           <p>
                              Recent several decades have witnessed the exponential growth in commercial data services, which lead to step in the so-called big data era. The pervasive increasing data traffic present both the imminent challenges and new opportunities to all aspects of wireless system design, such as efficient wireless caching, base station deployment and adaptive multiple access design. Machine learning, as one of the most promising artificial intelligence tools, has been invoked in many areas both in the academia and industry. Nevertheless, the application of machine learning in wireless communication scenarios is still in its infancy, which motivates to develop this project. The aim of this project is to use social media data to predict the requirements of mobile users for improving the performance of wireless networks. More particularly, a unified machine learning framework with the aid of the social media data is proposed in this project. Four stages are included in the proposed framework, which consists syntax processing, semantics analysis, data modelling and online prediction/refinement. The main benefits of the proposed framework is by utilizing the social media data which reflect the real requirements of users, to assist refining the motivation, problem formulation, and methodology of powerful machine learning algorithms in the context of wireless networks. The proposed framework is as follows.

                           <p>
                              Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has recently received remarkable attentions in numerous applications such as assisted living and remote monitoring. Existing solutions based on sensors and vision technologies have obtained achievements but still suffering from considerable limitations in the environmental requirement. Wireless signals like WiFi-based sensing has emerged as a new paradigm for HAR since it is convenient and not restricted in the environment. In this paper, a new WiFi-based and video-based neural network (WiNN) is proposed to improve the robustness of activity recognition where the synchronized video serves as the supplement for the wireless data. Moreover, a wireless-vision benchmark (WiVi) is collected for 9 class actions recognition in three different visual conditions, including the scenes without occlusion, with partial occlusion, and with full occlusion. Both machine learning method - support vector machine (SVM) as well as deep learning methods are used for the accuracy verification of the data set. We demonstrate that WiVi data set satisfies the primary demand and all three branches in proposed pipeline keep more than 80% of activity recognition accuracy over multiple action segmentation from 1s to 3s. In particular, WiNN is the most robust method in terms of all the actions on three action segmentation compared to the others.

                              Matching theory is a powerful tool to study the formation of dynamic and mutually beneficial relations among different types of rational and selfish
                              agents. It has been widely used to develop high performance, low complexity, and decentralized protocols. Recently, there has been significant progress in intensive

We are working on invoke matching theory to solve the resource allocation problems in 5G networks and beyond, such as in NOMA, D2D communications, heterogeneous cellular networks, millimeter wave communications, etc. A simple matching algorithm is listed as follows.

                           <p>
                              Stochastic geometry is a powerful mathematical and statistical tool for modeling and analyzing wireless networks. Unlike the traditional topology approaches which always ignore the density and mobility of nodes, stochastic geometry is capable of capturing the topological randomness of the networks and hence can provide tractable analytical results for the average network behaviors according to some distributions. This is particularly essential in large-scale networks which consist of a large number of randomly deployed nodes (e.g., BSs, mobile users, etc.) whose channels and locations are with high uncertainty. We are invoking stochastic geometry to model different wireless network scenarios, such as physical layer security, UAV communications, millimeter wave communications, NOMA, IoT networks, etc. Below figure is an example of stochastic geometry model, which shows the spatial distribution of a wireless powered secure D2D communication scenario.

                           <h4>8) Exploiting QoE Awareness in Wireless Networks: A Cross-Layer Perspective</h4>

                           <p>
                              Wireless networks are conventionally evaluated using PHY connection-centric metrics such as throughput or sum-rate capacity. However, conventional connection-centric designs have become a barrier to meeting the diverse application requirements and the quality expectation of the end users, especially for the rapid expanding visual-experience-oriented services, such as VR, AR, and video streaming. Even though the data rate and throughput are increasing, current mobile networks are still facing poor user experience and low service quality. The gap between the PHY system performance and higher-level user&#8217;s perceived experience drives a paradigm shift from connection-centric designs to experience-centric designs.

                              QoE is the perceptual quality of service (QoS) from the user&#8217;s perspective. Given the context that the growth of future traffic demands is largely driven by the visual-experience-oriented services, such as VR, AR, and video streaming, there is broad consensus among leading industry and academic initiatives that improving user&#8217;s QoE is a key pillar to sustaining the revenue of service providers in future networks.
